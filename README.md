# Advent of Code solutions in Common Lisp

## TODO

- 2016/11: it's taking 50+ seconds to generate solutions, and by looking at
  [Reddit's
  megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/5hoia9/2016_day_11_solutions/)
  it seems like there might be a few optimizations worth implementing
- 2016/14: it takes around 40 seconds to generate the solution for part 2, and
  I am not sure there is a more efficient way to solve this (e.g. faster md5
  implementation, avoid repeated string-to-bytes conversions)
