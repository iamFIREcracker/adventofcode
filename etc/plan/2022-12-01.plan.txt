* Solve [2022/01](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)
  - Super slow _at_ parsing input - I hate parsing lists into groups
  - For the life of me I swear I will never remember about the existence of STRING/= (I tried STRING!=, STRING<>, but nothing...)
  - Flipped the ordering for part 2, so ended up having to wait for 1 minute before I could try again; I should have realized, by looking at the output, that something was wrong...but whatever
