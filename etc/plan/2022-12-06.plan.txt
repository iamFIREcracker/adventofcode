* Solve [2022/06](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6)
  - First implementation, after 9 minutes, was giving me off-by-1 errors 
  - So I reimplemented it using a stack to keep track of the processed characters
  - Lost 1 minute for part 2 because I forgot to update a hard-coded number...shame on me
  - SUBSEQ indices always trip me up
