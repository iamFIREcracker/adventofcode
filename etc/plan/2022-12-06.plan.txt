* Solve [2022/06](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6)
  - First implementation, after 9 minutes, was giving me off-by-1 errors 
  - So I reimplemented it using a stack to keep track of the processed characters
  - Lost 1 minute for part 2 because I forgot to update a hard-coded number...shame on me
  - SUBSEQ indices always trip me up
* Fixed problem with 2018/23
  - Inside MAKE-BOX we were asserting that the newly created box had a volume which was a power of 2
  - This is how we were doing it: `(= (log volume 2) (floor (log volume 2)))`
  - However, the HyperSpec says that it's up to the implementation to decide if LOG should return the exact number or a float
    ```
* (log (expt 2 13) 2)
=> 12.999999
```
  - So I ended up implementing the pow2 check, properly
    ```
(defun pow2p (n)
  (and (/= n 0) (zerop (logand n (1- n)))))
```
  - Guess something changed, recently, in SBCL, that made this problem emerge
